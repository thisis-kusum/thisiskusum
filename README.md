## 👩‍🚀 About Me  
I am a final-year Mechanical Engineering student at **COEP Technological University**, with hands-on experience in **space systems, satellite structures, operations optimization, and automation tools**.  

My interests lie at the intersection of **space technology, systems engineering, operations research, and Industry 5.0**, where engineering meets decision-making and intelligent systems. I enjoy working in **cross-functional teams**, leading subsystems, and converting ideas into structured, implementable solutions.
